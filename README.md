# Applied_Statistics
This project involves analyzing the electricity spot market curves of demand and offers to develop a model capable of predicting the clearing price, which is computed from the intersection of these curves.
The work is divided into four main steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (with external variables too).
2. Smoothing functional data.
3. FPCA.
4. k-means (functional) clustering.
5. Prediction (functional regression with respect to external variables).
   
Promising results were obtained. Coding has been performed in R for statistical analysis.
